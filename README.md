This project was my very firsyt HTML project.

The objective was to try to recreate the Google homepage.

Takeaways:

- focus on <div> elements - how they can create a "box structure" in which to form other elements and content within. Check out your footer. Thats a good example. 

- Issue with this page is it is not responsive. I attempt to open in other media such as phone with different viewports and it will change the layout. Perhaps I will be taught more on this later in the Odin Project.
